# DifferentiableCurlNoiseï¼šOpen Source Code

## Introduction
#### This is the MATLAB implementation of the paper [Differentiable Curl-Noise: Boundary-Respecting Procedural Incompressible Flows Without Discontinuities](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/papers/Ding2023/Differentiable_Curl_Noise.pdf). In particular, we set up this repository to provide codes to generate the animations in our supplementary material.

## Installation
#### First, download the code from Github.
    git clone https://github.com/XinwenDing/DifferentiableCurlNoise.git
#### Before running the code, the user may want to make sure that the [SC toolbox](https://tobydriscoll.net/project/sc-toolbox/) is properly installed. Please check out [Section 2.4](https://tobydriscoll.net/project/sc-toolbox/guide.pdf) for detailed installation guidence in the user-guide of the SC toolbox.

## How to Get Started
#### There are a couple of "Main" files, and any of them can be a good start. 
#### Any file whose name starts with "flow_particle" plays the role of a "Main" file. These scripts create animations in our supplementary material.
#### Any file whose name starts with "contour_prep" calculates and save the contour matrix of $\psi'$ in our domain of interest. The "flow_particle" files use the contour generated by the "contour_prep" files.
