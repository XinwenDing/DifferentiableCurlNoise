# DifferentiableCurlNoise

## Introduction
### This is the MATLAB implementation of the paper [Differentiable Curl-Noise: Boundary-Respecting Procedural Incompressible Flows Without Discontinuities](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/papers/Ding2023/Differentiable_Curl_Noise.pdf). In particular, we set up this repository to provide codes to generate the animations in our supplementary material.

## Installation
### Before running the code, the user may want to make sure that the [SC toolbox](https://tobydriscoll.net/project/sc-toolbox/) is properly installed. Please check out [Section 2.4](https://tobydriscoll.net/project/sc-toolbox/guide.pdf) for detailed installation guidence in the user-guide of the SC toolbox.
